## About Me

Shreya Sheel is a fourth year doctoral student at the University of California Berkeley’s School of Education, studying Learning Sciences and Human Development, advised by <a href="https://bse.berkeley.edu/zachary-pardos">Zachary Pardos</a>. Her research interests are in the co-design and implementation of AI-assisted technologies in postsecondary education contexts, centering the needs, values, and experiences of the learners they impact. Her work investigates how educators and researchers can collaborate to understand the impacts, implications, and tensions of AI to improve student learning outcomes and upward mobility in degree completion. Her current work explores how an AI-assisted equivalency system might aid administrators' and faculty’s decision-making in approving course equivalencies across institutions and what factors lead to greater trust in the algorithmic system.
