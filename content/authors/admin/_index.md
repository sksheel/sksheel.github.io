Shreya Sheel is a third year doctoral student at the University of California Berkeley’s School of Education, studying Learning Sciences and Human Development. Her research interests are in the co-design and implementation of AI-assisted technologies in postsecondary education contexts. The heart of her research is in designing and co-creating “with” educators instead of “for” them. Her work is interdisciplinary in exploring how educators and researchers can collaborate to understand the impacts, implications, and tensions of AI to improve educational equity and upward mobility in degree completion.
